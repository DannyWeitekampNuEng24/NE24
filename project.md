## NE24 Project

The final project for this course consist of several items:

*  an [abstract](#Abstract-20150330) with a propsal for your project, due 3/30/15
*  the [project](#Project-20150501) itself, due 5/1/15
*  a [presentation](#presentation-20140427) about the project, given in class on 4/27/15

### Project: 2015/05/01 

The final project for this class is to submit a pull request to an open source coding project.
The project can be in any language that you want, but it should be hosted on GitHub or BitBucket. 
The pull request needs to tangibly contribute to the project in some way. 
This can be any of:

* adding new functionality
* adding or improving testing
* adding or improving documentation
* adding or improving exampels
* something else you feel the project would benefit from

This should allow you to tailor the project to your personal level of skill, while still pushing yourself to grow.

You may work with a partner or in a group of up to three people. 
If you choose this route, know that the scope of the project must increase compared to doing a project by yourself.

Places to look for projects:

* Open source projects organized by technical area that use SciPy: [here](http://www.scipy.org/topical-software.html#topic-guides-organized-by-scientific-field)
* PyNE, Python for Nuclear Engineering: [GitHub page](https://github.com/pyne/pyne) and [website](http://pyne.io/)
* If you find a useful list like this, add it and submit a pull request to this project page :).

### Abstract: 2015/03/30

Submit an abstract that is one page or less discussing what you will do for your project. This should include:

1. The project to which you would like to contribute
2. An outline of what you intend to do. 
Include specifically the objective you are trying to accomplish and why that will help the project.
3. Major steps required to execute the project.
4. Deadlines associated with each of these steps.
5. What you need to do to accomplish each step (laying out a path to success).
6. If you are working with a partner or in a group, specify how the work will be divided and who will do what.

-----------
### Presentation: 2015/04/27

We will do in-class presentations on the last day of class. 
The presentation length will depend upon how many groups we get, but for now plan on five minutes. 
The talk should include:

* What project you selected and what it is.
* What you did.
* Anything awesome you learned in the process.
